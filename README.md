Summary of my analysis (Also included on top of pymaceuticals_stater.ipynb)
### Analysis
***
* Out of the 10 drugs, Capomulin and Ramicane have the smallest tumor volume(mm3) averaging at around 40(mm3) each.

* Capomulin has the most observed mouse timepoints at 230, with Ramicane coming close at 228. This indicates a longer life span for the mice using these drugs.

* Capomulin had the lowest interquartile range at 7.78, indicating that its data is more consistently closer together.
***
* Exploring Capomulin further:

* Capomulin's data on mouse weight and average observed tumor volume has a strong correlation of .84.
* The R-squared for Capomulin's data on mouse weight and average observed tumor volume is 71%.
***
* Although Capomulin has good potential and was the only one explored further for this assignment, Ramicane should also be further explored.
